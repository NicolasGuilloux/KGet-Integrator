# KGet Integration for Google Chrome/Chromium

KGet Integration captures the downloads to download them in KGet. This application is designed for **Linux**.

This work was heavily based on the uGet Integrator. The only changes are a change of name, variables and icons. Plus the kget-integrator is smaller as KGet supports less features.


## Sources

Based on the [uGet Integrator](https://github.com/ugetdm/uget-integrator)

Icon from the [Papirus Icon Theme](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme)
